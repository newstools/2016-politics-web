THE ANCWL CONDEMNS THE RAPE CULTURE IN INSTITIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING 18 November 2016 The African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) condemns the rape culture perpetuating in the institutions of higher learning. The ANCWL has noted the reported case of sexual violence at the University of Witwatersrand where a case was reported over three weeks ago but no single step has been taken against the accused. In South African all men and women have equal protection under the law and therefore the law enforecement agencies need to ensure that these reports are throuroghly investigates and perpetrators face the full wrath of the law. The increasing rate of sexual violance cases in institutions of higher learning is concerning. The University of Stellenbsoch has about nine reported cases over the past five years and Rhodes University with thirteen reported cases bettween 2011 and 2015. The ANCWL reiterates it's 12th Conference Resolutions of advocating for strenthening women's safety and security in communities and it's continued support for the victims of violence and abuse. We call on the management in institutions of higher learning to ensure that safety and security measures are tightened. The Universities must involve law enforcement agencies in dealing with rape cases, internal mediation will never resolve the scourge of gender based violence in institutions. As we approach the 16 Days of Activism Against Women & Children, we call on the members of society to join hands with the ANCWL in raising awareness of the negative impacts of violance on women and children and rid society of sexual violence permanently. Safety of women and children is the responsibility of all society. Expose sexual violence and report incidents to law enforcement agencies. Let us all move together towards a safer South Africa.
