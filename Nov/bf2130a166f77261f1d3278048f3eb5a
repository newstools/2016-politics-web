STATE SECURITY MINISTER MAHLOBO MUST COME CLEAN The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (POPCRU) is concerned over allegations that link the State Security Minister David Mahlobo to known illegal rhino horn traders (see City Press report). About 702 rhinos have been poached between January and October this year. With these ever-increasing numbers, it has created a negative impact on our much-needed tourism industry and further continues to undermine government’s commitment and efforts to fight poaching. With the mandate of the State Security Agency (SSA) being  to provide the government with intelligence on domestic and foreign threats or potential threats to national stability among others, and the South African government now treating the poaching of rhinos as a threat to national security, we are of a firm view that Mr Mahlobo’s alleged association with illegal rhino horn traders undermine the integrity of the very department he is heading. As a person afforded the responsibility to control South Africa’s intelligence, which includes monitoring organised crime, these allegations are a huge blow to his standing in society as we all know that organised crime can only flourish under a corrupt environment. If those responsible for investigating such crimes befriend those committing them, the populace’s trust deficit on government institutions are bound to decline. We urge the Minister of the SSA to come clean on this matter, and call for an urgent investigation into the claims made. Statement issued by POPCRU, 13 November 2016
