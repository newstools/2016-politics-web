Kempton Park Hospital construction delayed 30 November 2016 In a written response to a DA question regarding the Gauteng Department of Health’s plans for the Kempton Park Hospital in Ekurhuleni, Health MEC, Qedani Mahlangu, indicated that the department plans to demolish the existing hospital and building a new one in its place. The MEC indicated that demolition will only start in the new year. This is contrary to her response to an Oral Question in the Legislature earlier this year, where she stated that at the end of 2016, there would be an architectural design finalised and that construction would commence in 2017. Further delays on Kempton Park Hospital are unacceptable as residents are becoming increasingly impatient with the slow pace of delivery on the site. According to the MEC, the cost for the new hospital has not yet been finalised. The DA welcomes the new 350-bed Level 1 District Hospital which the department intends to build as this will increase access to quality health facilities to the residents of Kempton Park and Tembisa. This will decrease the pressure on Tembisa Hospital which is currently struggling to cope with the increasing demand for health care.The DA will monitor the progress of construction whilst keeping a very close eye on supply chain management procedures and adherence to the Public Financial Management Act.
