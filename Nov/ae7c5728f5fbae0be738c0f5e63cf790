'Coffin duo' to apply for bail 30 November 2016 Middelburg – The two men who are seen in a video forcing Victor Mlotshwa into a coffin and threatening him are expected to appear in the Middleburg Magistrate's Court to reapply for bail, the National Prosecuting Authority confirmed on Wednesday. "The accused appointed council in the meantime to arrange for a bail application so they will be [in court] tomorrow [Thursday]," NPA regional spokesperson Monica Nyuswa said. On November 16, Theo Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen had abandoned their bail bid. They are facing charges of kidnapping and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, Nyuswa said. The case was originally postponed to January 25 while they remained in custody. Prosecutor Rean Lourens opposed bail. He said it was not in the interest of the community that the two be granted bail. The incident happened in August. During their appearance Mlotshwa was present in a packed court. Members of the ANC, DA and EFF protested outside the court. The alleged assault of Mlotshwa took place at the JM de Beer Boerdery, next to the Komati power station in Mpumalanga. In the 20-second video, which was posted on YouTube on November 7, one man, speaking in Afrikaans, forces Mlotshwa into a coffin and threatens to pour petrol on him.
