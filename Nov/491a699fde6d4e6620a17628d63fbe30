MEC Lesufi must act against the cash for jobs scandal 30 November 2016 The DA has once again told Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi to act on cash for jobs scandals. Replying to the Education Annual Report debate at the Legislature, the MEC expressed that he will not treat SADTU as gogo (monster). The excuse given by MEC Lesufi that he is waiting for national minister to act isn't good enough. Promotions and recruitment must be based on merit not by union membership. SADTU has been influencing decisions to appoint certain individuals not because they are the best for the job, but because they are friends and affiliates to the union. Some teachers were even asked for sex in order to receive a promotion. There is much evidence to prove this, and the department has failed dismally to protect the interests of excellent teachers and learners. There are always disputes lodged regarding the filling of vacant positions in Gauteng. Not enough is being done to ensure that the best people are appointed as HODs, Deputy Principals and Principals. One case in point is Oakdale secondary school in Ennerdale where the SGB chairperson refused to take a bribe and reported the matter to both police and the department. The fight against corruption can only be won if there is political will. Whistle blowers are prepared to fight corruption, but they need support from government. Appointments of undeserving individuals has a huge impact in the running of schools and the quality of education received by learners.
