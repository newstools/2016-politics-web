SAPS a non-show as 218 members wanted to take it to task about affirmative action – Solidarity Solidarity to turn to the Labour Court now Trade union Solidarity today said that the South African Police Service (SAPS) couldn’t care less about the legitimate grievances of its employees. This comes after the SAPS did not show up today at a conciliation session scheduled at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) despite the fact that it involves as many as 218 members of the Police who have been prejudiced. According to Solidarity spokesperson Renate Barnard, the issue arises from the fact that those 218 members of the SAPS have not been promoted in terms of the SSSBC Agreement 2/2011 and this because of the fact that they either don’t belong to the right race or the right gender. “It is totally ridiculous that the SAPS is discriminating against these hardworking members of the Service on the basis of their race and gender. Solidarity will not leave the matter there and will pursue it until justice prevails,” Barnard confirmed. Solidarity will now turn to the Labour Court.
