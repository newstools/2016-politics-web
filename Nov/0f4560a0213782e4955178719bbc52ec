IT’S TIME TO GET UNCOMFORTABLE AND CONFRONT RACISM 18 November 2016 The Inkatha Freedom Party has warned that a civil war could break out if a stop is not put to racism after two white men have been charged with assault when an online video emerged showing them pushing a black man into a coffin and threatening to burn him alive in Mpumalanga. “We are of the view that this recent incident has provoked many people and reminded them of past incidents like the killing of Chris Hani. Such incidents must not be allowed to happen in our free and democratic country because they might fuel tensions and divide communities. We don’t want to find ourselves experiencing a civil war which will be difficult even for the government to diffuse. There is an urgent need for some people to have a change of attitude and eradicate racism,” said IFP National Chairperson Mr Blessed Gwala. “We feel that existing legislation against racism must be strengthened. Laws will not change people’s attitudes overnight, but it certainly will clamp down on overt displays of racism. The fight against racism requires more than just the law. It requires all individuals, organisations and communities to voice their collective opposition to this threat against peaceful co-existence,” continued Mr Gwala. “Enhanced cooperation is vital as progress in the fight against racism and intolerance is often the result of combined actions. We call on government to develop and implement a multi-year programme of activities to provide for a renewed and strengthened outreach to inform and mobilise people to eradicate the scourge of racism,” concluded Mr Gwala. The IFP calls for concrete action to eradicate racism in our society. Statement issued by Mr Blessed Gwala, IFP National Chairperson, 18 November 2016
