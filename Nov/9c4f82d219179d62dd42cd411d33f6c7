SABC 8 must be given SAPS protection Reports that the SABC 8 continue to be subjected to intimidation and death threats are cause for serious concern. According to media reports, the SABC 8 are living in fear following a series of sinister incidents and death threats aimed at forcing them to drop their court action against the public broadcaster. In September, the SABC 8 advised the Constitutional Court that they intend persisting with their court action because the culture of censorship and fear in the SABC’s newsrooms persists, despite their reinstatement. It is quite clear that high-powered individuals with interest in the outcome of the court case are behind the death threats. As such, the DA will be writing to the Acting National Police Commissioner, Khomotso Phahlane requesting that the SABC 8 be given police protection until the court case is finalised. When the Ad Hoc Committee on the SABC meets for the first time on Tuesday, the DA will insist that the parliamentary inquiry into the SABC take place this year still. Parliament cannot go into recess with such serious governance issues plaguing the public broadcaster unresolved. We will also continue with our court action to have Hlaudi Motsoeneng removed from the SABC. The case will be heard on 23 and 24 November 2016. It is a sad day when journalists are intimidated for fighting for the constitutional right to report the news without fear and intimidation. All of South Africa should be outraged by the terrorising of our journalists. Statement issued by Phumzile Van Damme, DA Shadow Minister of Communications, 13 November 2016
