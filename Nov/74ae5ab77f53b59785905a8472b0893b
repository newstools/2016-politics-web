Allow police time to conclude Mahlobo investigation - Radebe 17 November 2016 Cape Town – Police should be given time to investigate the allegations against State Security Minister David Mahlobo, Minister Jeff Radebe said on Thursday. The minister in the presidency was briefing media following a fortnightly Cabinet meeting. Radebe said Cabinet had noted the allegations in an Al Jazeera documentary against Mahlobo. They had also noted that the South African Police Service was investigating the allegations. Mahlobo has been in the spotlight following allegations that he was a frequent visitor to the massage parlour of a well-known self-confessed criminal named Guan Jiang Guang. On Thursday Radebe was asked whether Mahlobo was called on to account on the matter or not, and if he had heard that the massage parlour was "partly a brothel". The minister would not be drawn on the matter. "Let's allow the investigation to conclude on Mahlobo," he said. In the documentary, Guan, who is also allegedly involved in a rhino poaching syndicate, openly brags about bribing South African justice and immigration officials. Video secretly recorded by an undercover investigator shows Guan swiping through photographs on his phone that appear to show him and Mahlobo. "He came to my massage parlour every week, or at least twice a month," Guan says. "I know him well … [He was] a guest at my home." This article first appeared on News24, see here.
