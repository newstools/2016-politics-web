DA calls on President Zuma to reprimand or fire Muthambi for defying Cabinet on Hlaudi The DA will write to President Jacob Zuma to request that he reprimand or fire Communications Minister, Faith Muthambi, for defying Cabinet’s position on the appointment of Hlaudi Motsoeneng to his new position at the SABC. In a reply to a DA parliamentary question yesterday, President Zuma confirmed that Minister Muthambi is bound by Cabinet’s resolution on the appointment of Mr Motsoeneng. Cabinet’s position, as expressed by Minister Jeff Radebe on 30 September 2016, strongly condemned Mr Motsoeneng’s re-appointment at the SABC. He stated: The decision to reappoint Mr Motsoeneng in a new position shows disrespect of a rule of law. Cabinet calls on the SABC Board to abide by the letter and spirit of the SCA ruling. Yet, Minister Muthambi endorsed and supported Mr Motsoeneng’s appointment as Group Executive of Corporate Affairs, a clear expression of her blatant defiance of Cabinet’s position in this regard. We therefore call on President Zuma to strongly reprimand or fire Minister Muthambi, which would be a step in the right direction to restoring and stabilising the public broadcaster which Motsoeneng has systematically eroded and which Minister Muthumbi has ignored.
