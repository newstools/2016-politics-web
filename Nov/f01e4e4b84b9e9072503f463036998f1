DA and civil society succeed in opening Committee briefing on nuclear build to the public The DA, together with civil society has succeeded in opening the briefing by the Department of Energy to the Portfolio Committee on the new nuclear build programme to the public. The DA will now seek a formal confirmation, in writing, from the Committee Chairperson, Fikile Majola, that his commitment to open the briefing to the public will remain intact. This goes to show what can be achieved when we work together to ensure that Parliament works for the people of South Africa. Yesterday, after large public outcry, the DA wrote to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Energy, Fikile Majola, and to the Chair of Chairs, Cedric Frolick, to demand that they reverse the decision to close the briefing. The DA firmly believes that the public deserve to know what is going on with regards to the nuclear build programme which South Africa does not need and cannot afford. In the Committee, the DA will continue to ensure that Parliament fulfils its mandate of real and meaningful oversight at this critical time.
