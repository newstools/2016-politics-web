The ANCWL statement on the political smear campaign against Cde Bathabile Dlamini by The Daily Maverick 15 December 2016 The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) has noted a politically smear campaign published in the Daily Maverick linking the President of the ANCWL Cde Bathabile Dlamini in her capacity as the Minister for Social Development with Cash Paymaster Services. Whilst these allegations are made about Cde Bathabile in her capacity as Minister for Social Development, it is the ANCWL conviction that, this is a calculated political move to discredit the work of ANCWL President and her leadership collective for fearlessly and unapologetically championing the socio-economic agenda of women in South Africa for the benefit of women- in particular black women. Furthermore this political smear campaign is funded and carried out by those who have consciously taken a decision to cause disunity in the ANC and society in general.  They are hoping that by attacking one of the leaders within integral part of the ANC which is the ANCWL they will liquidate the ANC. No amount of smear campaign to any leader of the ANCWL will derail the organization in working to strengthen and unite the ANC as the leader in society. The ANCWL will work around the clock  towards making the ANC an even more effective instrument for liberation in the hands of the people. The unity and integrity of the ANC is of paramount importance to the ANCWL and under the leadership of Cde Bathabile, the ANCWL stays united, resolute and an unshaken integral part of ANC.
