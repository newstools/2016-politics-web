DA to proceed with laying of criminal charges against Collen Maine 17 October 2016 The DA welcomes the ANC’s decision to instruct ANCYL President (better referred to as Zuma’s Defence League leader), Collen Maine, to withdraw his dangerous, unlawful and irresponsible comments. However, this does not negate the criminality of his conduct, and we will accordingly proceed with laying criminal charges against Mr Maine with the South African Police Service. Incitement of violence is a very serious crime that goes against the spirit and intent of our Constitution, and the principle of the Rule of Law. In keeping with these key constitutional principles, it is essential that this results in a full investigation. It cannot be wished away or undone. The DA will announce shortly the details regarding the laying of charges against Mr Maine. Issued by Yussuf Cassim, DASO Leader, 17 October 2016
