Teargas, rubber bullets fired at UKZN students 17 October 2016 Durban - Police fired teargas and rubber bullets at University of KwaZulu-Natal students who threw stones and bottles from the windows of their Westville campus residence on Monday. About 40 minutes after a group of female students, who were protesting illegally outside the P Block residence, were told to disperse, students who had their faces covered with T-shirts blocked a road on campus with a television set and rubbish bins. The group of about 100 female students had gathered earlier on Monday morning to protest peacefully in solidarity with their peers who were arrested last week. They sought permission to protest peacefully, but were told that the earliest they could possibly be granted permission to protest would be Wednesday.
