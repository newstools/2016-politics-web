AfriForum requests investigation by PP 17 October 2016 AfriForum addressed a letter to Busisiwe Mkhwebane, the new Public Protector (PP), as well as Winnie Manyathela, the Head of the Gauteng offices of the PP, today in which the civil rights watchdog requests an investigation against Collen Maine, president of the ANC Youth League. This request follows after Maine purchased a property in the Woodhill Estate in Pretoria at the end of 2015, to the value of R5,4 million. “AfriForum already indicated in April this year that there are more questions than answers regarding this purchase. A home loan was approved by the Bank of India, despite the fact that this bank does not cater for home loans,” says Henk Maree, National Spokesperson for AfriForum. City Press reported today that the controversial Gupta family is also involved with the purchasing process of Maine’s property. AfriForum requests, among other things, that the PP investigates the following: - The legality of the process in which Maine obtained the loan - A full investigation into Maine’s financial statements, seeing as he needs to make a monthly payment of R136 665 - The influence of the controversial Gupta family during the process Issued by Henk Maree, National Spokesperson, AfriForum, 17 October 2016
