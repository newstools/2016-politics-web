Absenteeism worsens at Bara hospital 5 October 2016 Absenteeism at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital has worsened, with 764 employees (12.26%) absent last year out of a total staff of 6221. This information is revealed by Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. According to Mahlangu, "habitual truancy" and "substance and alcohol abuse" are identified trends in the high absenteeism, but only 12 employees were disciplined last year for their absence. I am concerned that one out of eight employees were absent at this hospital, which is an increase on the 669 (10%) of employees who were absent in 2013 according to a reply to a previous question that I asked in this matter. The high absenteeism shows poor management and puts strain on those staff members who have to fill in the gaps caused by absent colleagues. Hospital management should get tough on unexplained absence and implement effective discipline to get better work attendance. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Health, 5 October 2016
