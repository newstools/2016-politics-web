Statement of the ANC on remarks attributed to ANC Youth League President Collen Maine 17 October 2016 The African National Congress (ANC) has noted comments attributed to ANC Youth League President, Comrade Collen Maine, calling on uMkontho weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) to take up arms in defence of the President of the ANC, Comrade Jacob Zuma. The ANC views these utterances as unfortunate, irresponsible and reckless. The freedom, peace and stability we enjoy in South Africa today came at a price. Amongst those freedoms, is the right to freedom of expression, which does not extend to inflammatory remarks such as those made by the Youth League President and should never be allowed to find space in our democratic society. Challenges facing society should at all times be resolved on the basis of platforms of co-existence agreed to by South Africans, which include amongst them the checks and balances between the branches of government, our Chapter 9 institutions which support constitutional democracy, law enforcement agencies etc. Current challenges facing South Africa require reasoned, cogent and decisive leadership, not provocative and demagogic talk. Accordingly, the ANC has instructed the ANC Youth League President to retract these comments. President Zuma is the democratically elected leader of our country, with more than 11 million South Africans having affirmed him as leader of our government in the recently held General Elections in 2014. He continues to enjoy overwhelming support from the majority of members of the ANC and society at large. Issued by Zizi Kodwa, National Spokesperson, ANC, 17 October 2016
