Mangaung Metro wastes R300 000 on a gala dinner amidst financial crisis 17 October 2016 The Democratic Alliance in Mangaung will boycott tomorrow’s gala dinner organised by the Mangaung Metro Municipality to bid farewell to outgoing committee members. About 700 people have been invited to the event which will cost the municipality an estimated R300 000 or more. The DA cannot be part of this excessive waste by a municipality that is facing a huge financial strain. The municipality is currently battling to pay suppliers on time and this results in service delivery backlog. The DA sees no value in a farewell function but regards it as a waste of money that could have been used to deliver better services for the people. There is a complete lack of urgency in serving our people by this new administration. This lack of leadership is shameful when so many people face poor service delivery and are unemployed. Waste of money has become a trend in the ANC run municipalities where Mayors prioritise fun instead of service delivery. It seems like there will be a celebratory event every month but no effective services to our people. The DA is committed in rendering quality services; ensuring a clean, well run government that creates jobs, supports SMME’s and put the people at the centre of development, not hosting luxurious parties for a selected few. We will ask questions at the Council to ascertain the exact amount spent to host this extravagant event. Issued by Joalane Rantai, DA Councillor, Mangaung Metro, 17 October 2016
