The following is a petition launched by a group of concerned staff and students at the University of Cape Town appealing for the reopening of campus on Monday. The petition page – where UCT staff and students can add their names – can be found here. UCT Staff and Student Petition in Favour of Peaceful Reopening We, the undersigned members of the University of Cape Town, believe: - that we have a responsibility to our current and future students, and to their families, to complete the academic teaching year; - that we must resume teaching now if we are to carry out that responsibility; - that the university is doing everything possible to support the student demand for normalisation of relations and for free education; - that the University is fully committed to and actively engaged in institutional transformation including pedagogical and curriculum transformation and has invested significant monetary resources and managerial time to the transformation of staff and curricula; - that many students are highlighting areas of ongoing suffering and that we will redouble our efforts to address them; - that we have a compelling responsibility to protect the university and its resources for future generations of South Africans; - that violence, and threats of violence, directed at any members of the institution and its facilities are equally intolerable. We duly call upon our colleagues and the student body to: - allow teaching to resume from Monday October 17th 2016, to allow students to sit their exams and complete the year; - respect the urgent personal and collective interests and rights of the majority of students and staff; - engage peacefully and respectfully with all university stakeholders in order to support the student demand for free education; And we enjoin management to deploy the minimal necessary security required to protect staff and students.
