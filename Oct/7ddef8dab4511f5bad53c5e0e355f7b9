6 arrested UCT student released without charges Cape Town - Six arrested UCT students are being released without being charged. Their attorney Lufuno Musetsho said on Tuesday that the students were in the process of being released from the Claremont police station after spending the night in the station's holding cells. Western Cape police on Tuesday confirmed the arrest of the three male and three female students, aged 21 and 22. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the case had not been put on the roll due to a lack of evidence. They were released by police before midday on Tuesday. This was after Advocate Mustaque Holland tried to get them released since their arrest on campus on Monday afternoon. Police also confirmed that UCT student activist Masixole Mlandu was arrested on Tuesday morning on a charge of intimidation. Musetsho would also represent Mlandu, who is one of five students who was served with an interdict for his role in February's Shackville protest over university accommodation.
