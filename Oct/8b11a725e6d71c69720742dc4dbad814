DA submits Gordhan’s statement on NPA to support Debate of Public Importance 17 October 2016 The DA has submitted the statement released by the Minister of Finance, Pravin Gordhan’s legal team, on the charges that were brought against him, to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, to support our request for a Debate of Public Importance on the politicisation of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). The statement released by Gildenhuys Malatji Inc noted that Minister Gordhan decided not to make representations to the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) on the charges that were brought against him because “he does not have any confidence in the NDPP’s ability or willingness to afford him a fair hearing.” While it may be that there is a case to answer, and we trust in our courts to make such a determination, it is extremely worrying that there is such a serious suggestion that a fair trial will not be afforded, especially given the suspicion surrounding these charges. Indeed, given the timing of the charges, as well as those against EFF Leader, Julius Malema, serious aspersions have been cast over the independence and impartiality of our prosecuting authority. This warrants an urgent debate in the House, so that the elected representatives of the people can ensure that the matter is appropriately ventilated and if need be steps taken to ensure accountability. An independent prosecuting authority, which acts without fear or favour, is a fundamental cornerstone of a functioning constitutional democracy. It is therefore vital that we interrogate the very serious concerns raised with the NPA and NDPP, Adv Shaun Abrahams, sooner rather than later.
